# ðŸ“Œ Performance Test Configuration
# ================================

# âœ… Define the types of performance tests to run
# Options: "load" (simulates expected traffic), "stress" (tests system breaking point)
testType:
  - load
  - stress

# âœ… Base URL of the application under test
# âœ… Define Base URLs for different environments
baseURLs:
  dev: "https://dev.saucedemo.com"
  staging: "https://staging.saucedemo.com"
  prod: "https://www.saucedemo.com"

# âœ… User credentials used for authentication during testing
users:
  username: "standard_user"
  password: "secret_sauce"

# âœ… Performance Thresholds
# ========================
thresholds:
  # ðŸ“Œ Response Time Requirements
  # - Ensures 90% of requests complete in under 3 seconds
  # - Ensures 95% of requests complete in under 5 seconds
  # - Ensures 99% of requests complete in under 10 seconds
  http_req_duration:
    - "p(90)<3000"
    - "p(95)<5000"
    - "p(99)<10000"

  # ðŸ“Œ Error Rate Monitoring
  # - Ensures that failed HTTP requests remain below 1%
  http_req_failed: ["rate<0.01"]

  # ðŸ“Œ Functional Checks
  # - Ensures that at least 99% of key assertions (e.g., login success) pass
  checks: ["rate>0.99"]
